    Quickstart installation guides are currently available for
    Linux (most common Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE).
    Because some distributions are similar you may succeed 
    to use these intructions for RedHat, CentOS, Debian and SLES as well.

    If you are installing Icinga on an operating system or
    Linux distribution that isn't listed above, read 
    <xref linkend="wb_quickstart-icinga" /> for an overview of what
    you'll need to do.

    Command names, paths, etc. vary widely across different 
    Operating Systems/Distributions, so you'll likely need 
    to tweak the installation docs a bit to work for your 
    particular case.
