  <title>Verifying Your Configuration</title>

  <para>Every time you modify your configuration files, you also have to
  restart Icinga. It is important to run a sanity check on your configuration
  files because in case of an error Icinga will not start/be restarted.</para>

  <para>In order to verify your configuration, run Icinga using the <emphasis
  role="bold">-v</emphasis> command line option:</para>

  <programlisting>
    /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -v /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg
  </programlisting>

  <para>If you've forgotten to enter some critical data or misconfigured
  things, Icinga will show a warning or error message that should point you to
  the location of the problem.</para>

  <para>Error messages generally print out the line in the configuration file
  that seems to be the source of the problem.</para>

  <para>On errors, Icinga will often exit the pre-flight check and return to
  the command prompt after printing only the first error that it has
  encountered.</para>

  <para>This is done because one error might lead to consecutive errors as the
  remainder of the configuration data is verified.</para>

  <para>If you get any error messages you'll need to go and edit your
  configuration files to remedy the problem. Warning messages can
  <emphasis>generally</emphasis> be safely ignored, since they are only
  recommendations and not requirements.</para>

  <para>Once you've verified your configuration files and fixed possible
  errors you can go ahead with <xref linkend="wb_startstop" />.</para>
