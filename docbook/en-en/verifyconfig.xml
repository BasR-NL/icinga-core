    Every time you modify your configuration files, you also
    have to restart Icinga. It is important to run a sanity check on
    your configuration files because in case of an error Icinga will
    not start/be restarted.
  </para>
  <para>
    In order to verify your configuration, run Icinga using the
    <emphasis role="bold">-v</emphasis> command line option:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
    /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -v /usr/local/icinga/etc/icinga.cfg
  </programlisting>
  <para>
    If you've forgotten to enter some critical data or
    misconfigured things, Icinga will show a warning or error message
    that should point you to the location of the problem.
  </para>
  <para>
    Error messages generally print out the line in the configuration 
    file that seems to be the source of the problem. 
  </para>
  <para>
    On errors, Icinga will often exit the pre-flight check and 
    return to the command prompt after printing only the first 
    error that it has encountered. 
  </para>
  <para>
    This is done because of one error does not cascade
    into multiple errors as the remainder of the configuration data
    is verified. 
  </para>
  <para>
    If you get any error messages you'll need to go and
    edit your configuration files to remedy the problem. Warning
    messages can <emphasis>generally</emphasis> be safely ignored, 
    since they are only recommendations and not requirements.
  </para>
  <para>
    Once you've verified your configuration files and fixed
    possible errors you can go ahead with
