# These are newly ADDED config options for IDO2DB.CFG only.

# ENABLE TRANSACTIONS - EXPERIMENTAL!
# This setting enables SQL transactions during data processing. It will
# be useful when dumping config objects and their relations (contacts, etc),
# during normal operations it won't help that much.
# The intention is clearly to reduce the reload/restart time when idomod
# dumps the config data, blocking the core.
#
# WARNING: uses BEGIN / COMMIT for the transactions - make sure this
# works with your DBMS!
