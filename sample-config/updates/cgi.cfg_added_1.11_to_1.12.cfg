# URL CGI PATH
# This is the path portion of the URL that corresponds to the
# physical location of the Icinga CGI files. It is evaluated by
# the cmd.cgi CSRF protection.
# This value should be changed if the CGI files are accessible
# under a different path than the default installation path.

#url_cgi_path=@htmurl@/cgi-bin

# SET_STICKY_ACKNOWLEDGMENT
# This either sets or clears the checkbox in the CGIs for sticky
# acknowledgments.  Valid options are "1" and "0"; a 0 clears the
# checkbox and 1 sets it.  The default is 1 (set) to preserve
# backward compatibility.

#set_sticky_acknowledgment=1
