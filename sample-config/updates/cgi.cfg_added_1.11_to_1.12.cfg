# URL CGI PATH
# This is the path portion of the URL that corresponds to the
# physical location of the Icinga CGI files. It is evaluated by
# the cmd.cgi CSRF protection.
# This value should be changed if the CGI files are accessible
# under a different path than the default installation path.

#url_cgi_path=@htmurl@/cgi-bin



# SORT STATUS DATA BY DEFAULT
# This option forces status.cgi to sort status data by default. Data will
# be sorted ascending. First host name and then service description. This is
# helpful if status data in status.dat is not sorted properly. This can occur
# especially if you use Icinga2. By default this options is switched off (0)
# to avoid possible higher cpu load in huge environments.
